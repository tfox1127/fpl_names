Just a quick update this week as we're getting everything setup still.<br><br>
Congrats to Ryan Swaim on this week's manager of the week with a score of 77.  A couple of great scores from Saiss and James in today's games saw him jump to the top of the table.<br><br>
LMS starts in GW2 which kicks off early (6am ET) on Saturday<br><br>

Here is the GW 2 update.  Some crazy polarizing scores.<br><br>
Congrats to Jake for winning Manager of the Week with a huge score of 90 after captain KDB brought it home today<br><br>
Commiserations to Ray and Scott for crashing out in the first week of LMS with scores of 40 and 33 respectively<br><br>
Details of the group stage draw and fixtures are included for the Europa/Champions League which kicks off in GW18 are included.  Your LMS finish will determine your draw.<br><br>
GW3 kicks off on Saturday morning again, when another 2 teams with the lowest score will go out of LMS.  Good luck in GW3!<br><br>
lastly...if there's anything that isn't clear to any of the new members of the league please DM me on Slack - more than happy to explain.  Thanks all!<br><br>

We're finally at the end of one crazy gameweek.<br><br>
Congrats to Mik Malo for winning this week's manager of the week with a great score of 62 in a low scoring week and he's setting the pace in the league now too! Mik Maloney<br><br>
commiserations to tFox and Syed Abidi for going out in this week's LMS with scores of 30 and 32 respectively<br><br>
Syed Abidi losing out on the base team score tiebreaker to Mike Reiffsteck<br><br>

Another GW in the books with an average of over 4 goals per game and crazy upsets this week - the Premier League is certainly entertaining this year.<br><br>
Congrats to Mike Reiffsteck for winning this week's Manager of the Week with a score of 82!<br><br>
Commiserations to DLC and Forrest Dyer for crashing out of LMS with miserable scores of 28 ad 37.  We both go into Group E for the European Cups as the snake draft starts filling up the second player in each group.  2 more will go out of LMS again in GW5.<br><br>
Pace setter Mik Maloney is still setting the pace at the top of the league, 7 points clear of #1 ranked Hall of Famer Ryan Swaim with Chris Parkin rounding off the top 3.<br><br>
It's the International Break now (thank god) so no games next week - we will be back on Oct 17 for GW5.<br><br>
Reminder to Mik Maloney (not that he needs to change anything) and mskouyoudjian that you have 1 free transfer each week to use to change your team up. Just noticed that you both haven't used a transfer yet this season.<br><br>
Enjoy the week off everyone!  See you all in 2 weeks time - good luck for GW5!<br><br>

Congrats to @Raymond Bleth for winning Manager of the Week with the highest score of the season so far - 92.<br><br>

Commiserations to @Mike Doherty and @Mik Maloney for going out of LMS with scores of 33 each in a very close fought contest this week that went down to the last match.<br><br>
@Jake Dyer is now setting the pace at the top of the league after playing his wildcard and getting a solid score of 53 when the previous league leaders had a bad week.  @Michael Adams and @Robert Aikens round off the top 3.<br><br>
GW7 kicks off on Friday again this week and another 2 managers will go out of LMS - we are already down to 15, the contest is heating up!<br><br>
Good luck to everyone in GW7!<br><br>

Week 7 Update
Congrats to @Luke Schreiber and @Kevin for winning this week's Manager of the Week with a huge score of 107!  They also go into pole position for the highest score of the season prize.  The score was even more impressive given only 9 of their players played, and their midfield scored 77 points which is almost more than any other team in the league this week!<br><br>
Commiserations to @Cooper Reeves and @Mo Alrisheq who went out of LMS this week with scores of 38 and 44 respectively.  Only 13 left in LMS now with another 2 due to leave in GW8.<br><br>
@Luke Schreiber and @Kevin also feature on this week's best transfer, bringing in Ziyech for James Rodriguez.  @Mikael Nilsson features in the transfer news after he wildcarded out Grealish and Wilson<br><br>
Lots of jockeying for position in the league still, with less than 50 points separating the top 20.  @Jake Dyer still in #1 spot with @Ryan Swaim and @Robert Aikens just behind.<br><br>
2 games on Friday so the deadline is even earlier in GW8 - don't miss it.  Good luck all!<br><br>

Week 8 Update
Gameweek 8 update is attached and we are into another International Break (booooring!)<br><br>
Congrats to @Forrest Dyer for an incredible Wildcard that netted him 43 points over the team he transferred out and a huge 99 points for the gameweek winning him Manager of the Week!<br><br>
Commiserations to @nmulford and @Brian for going out of LMS this week with scores of 45 points (just 1 point from safety!).  Watkins scoring a brace on @Brianâ€™s bench, a cruel way to end the week.<br><br>
I've added in change in rank this week which shows @Forrest Dyer moved up 15 places from 18th to 3rd in the league!  On the other end, the biggest falls were @Brian and @Eduardo Tierney who dropped 7 places to 20th and 21st.<br><br>
2 weeks until the next GW now, where 2 more will go out of LMS - we are down to 11 managers now.  GW9 is the last week where 2 will be eliminated - congrats to those that have made it this far!<br><br>
Good luck in GW9!<br><br>

Best transfers of the week goes to @Mike Reiffsteck who brought in and captained Bruno as well as Calvert-Lewin for Salah and Wilson.  Worst transfers was @Luke Schreiber / @Kevin who sold Calvert-Lewin, Aurier and Salah for Bamford, Aubameyang (C) and Walker.<br><br>

GW10 is over and we're down to 8 in LMS!<br><br>
A painful final game watching Watkins somehow not get a single point, but I still managed to escape with this week's MotW with a score of 62.<br><br>
Commiserations to @mskouyoudjian who went out of LMS this week with a score of 32 - congrats to the last 8 managers remaining.  1 manager will get knocked out each gameweek now until the New Year.<br><br>
@Eduardo Tierney was the biggest positive mover in the league, moving up 7 places to 10th.  @Cooper Reeves went in the other direction moving 6 places down to 19th.  Still all extremely close as less than 50 points covers 9th to 23rd.<br><br>
@Robert Aikens remains at the top of the league but @Forrest Dyer has narrowed the gap to just 6 points with @Mike Doherty a further 11 behind.<br><br>
I've added some simple stats which help highlight some of the key PL teams to target on page 5.<br><br>
Also, make sure to check out some of the upgrades @tFox has made to the live scoring on our website www.negatrophy.com/live - some incredible work showing how important each player's GW score is to your team in relation to the rest of the league along with some other cool stats and features.

Lastly, heads up if you did not already know - 5 GW18 fixtures have been rescheduled into GW19, so GW18 is now a blank GW with only 10 teams playing and GW19 is a double GW with 10 teams playing twice.  A great opportunity to score some big points with a bit of planning!<br><br>

COVID strikes again with two games getting canceled this week and the potential for more to be canceled in GW17.  Fulham and Man City the teams hit hardest but Sheff Utd reported to also have a high number of positive tests.  Some very bad luck for some managers - couldn't have come at a worse time for @Eduardo Tierney who crashes out of LMS with 4 of his starting XI getting impacted by the cancelations. As a result, @Eduardo Tierney goes into Group C of the Euro Cup competitions and will faceoff against @tFox, @Andy Georgevich, @Nate and @Jake Dyer for Champions League qualification.<br><br>
Congrats to @Robert Aikens and @Mikael Nilsson who scored well in a difficult week with 61 and 71 respectively to qualify for the LMS Grand Finale! @Mikael Nilsson clinching the second Festive Manager of the Week title along with $20.  Good luck to you both in the GW17 final.<br><br>
In the league, @Robert Aikens and @Mike Doherty are quietly building up a substantial lead, with @Robert Aikens 22 points ahead of @Mike Doherty and a further 46 ahead of @Forrest Dyer in 3rd place, who got hit really hard this week by the cancelations.<br><br>
@Mikael Nilsson also the biggest mover in the league this week, climbing 4 places from 12th up to 8th.  @Michael Adams headed in the opposite direction dropping from 6th to 9th.<br><br>
GW17 kicks off on Friday morning - so don't miss the deadline.  The last fixture of the congested period, so we will have a 10 day or so break before GW18 and the European Cup kicks off.  A nice rest after we've rounded off LMS and determined our first major prize winner for the season - let's hope COVID doesn't spoil the final and that all the (real life) players are fit and healthy.<br><br>
Good luck all<br><br>
