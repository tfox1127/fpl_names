Just a quick update this week as we're getting everything setup still.<br><br>
Congrats to Ryan Swaim on this week's manager of the week with a score of 77.  A couple of great scores from Saiss and James in today's games saw him jump to the top of the table.<br><br>
LMS starts in GW2 which kicks off early (6am ET) on Saturday<br><br>

Here is the GW 2 update.  Some crazy polarizing scores.<br><br>
Congrats to Jake for winning Manager of the Week with a huge score of 90 after captain KDB brought it home today<br><br>
Commiserations to Ray and Scott for crashing out in the first week of LMS with scores of 40 and 33 respectively<br><br>
Details of the group stage draw and fixtures are included for the Europa/Champions League which kicks off in GW18 are included.  Your LMS finish will determine your draw.<br><br>
GW3 kicks off on Saturday morning again, when another 2 teams with the lowest score will go out of LMS.  Good luck in GW3!<br><br>
lastly...if there's anything that isn't clear to any of the new members of the league please DM me on Slack - more than happy to explain.  Thanks all!<br><br>

We're finally at the end of one crazy gameweek.<br><br>
Congrats to Mik Malo for winning this week's manager of the week with a great score of 62 in a low scoring week and he's setting the pace in the league now too! Mik Maloney<br><br>
commiserations to tFox and Syed Abidi for going out in this week's LMS with scores of 30 and 32 respectively<br><br>
Syed Abidi losing out on the base team score tiebreaker to Mike Reiffsteck<br><br>
GW4 kicks off early on Saturday again then we get a week off before GW5 because of the International Break<br><br>
2 more managers will go out of LMS in GW4<br><br>
Good luck all!<br><br>

Another GW in the books with an average of over 4 goals per game and crazy upsets this week - the Premier League is certainly entertaining this year.<br><br>
Congrats to Mike Reiffsteck for winning this week's Manager of the Week with a score of 82!<br><br>
Commiserations to DLC and Forrest Dyer for crashing out of LMS with miserable scores of 28 ad 37.  We both go into Group E for the European Cups as the snake draft starts filling up the second player in each group.  2 more will go out of LMS again in GW5.<br><br>
Pace setter Mik Maloney is still setting the pace at the top of the league, 7 points clear of #1 ranked Hall of Famer Ryan Swaim with Chris Parkin rounding off the top 3.<br><br>
It's the International Break now (thank god) so no games next week - we will be back on Oct 17 for GW5.<br><br>
Reminder to Mik Maloney (not that he needs to change anything) and mskouyoudjian that you have 1 free transfer each week to use to change your team up. Just noticed that you both haven't used a transfer yet this season.<br><br>
Enjoy the week off everyone!  See you all in 2 weeks time - good luck for GW5!<br><br>

Week 5 Update
FPL is back with GW5 seeing so many draws (ties)!<br><br>
Congrats to @Raymond Bleth for winning Manager of the Week with the highest score of the season so far - 92.<br><br>
Congrats to @Mike Doherty who hits the top of the league and is the only manager to top 300 points so far, our long time leader@Mik Maloney just 5 points back.<br><br>
Commiserations to @Chris Parkin and @Andy Georgevich for going out of LMS this week with scores of 39 and 42 respectively.  17 remain in LMS with another 2 going out in GW6.<br><br>
GW6 kicks off on Friday this week - don't miss the deadline!  Good luck all!<br><br>

Week 6 Update
Attached is the update for GW6 - check out our new transfer page which shows the impact of players bought and sold each week and showcases the best and worst moves in terms of FPL points. @Chris Parkin and @Mike Reiffsteck feature on this week's transfer moves.<br><br>
Congrats to @Cooper Reeves for winning this week's Manager of the Week with a great score of 66 in an otherwise low scoring week.<br><br>
Commiserations to @Mike Doherty and @Mik Maloney for going out of LMS with scores of 33 each in a very close fought contest this week that went down to the last match.<br><br>
@Jake Dyer is now setting the pace at the top of the league after playing his wildcard and getting a solid score of 53 when the previous league leaders had a bad week.  @Michael Adams and @Robert Aikens round off the top 3.<br><br>
GW7 kicks off on Friday again this week and another 2 managers will go out of LMS - we are already down to 15, the contest is heating up!<br><br>
Good luck to everyone in GW7!<br><br>

Week 7 Update
Congrats to @Luke Schreiber and @Kevin for winning this week's Manager of the Week with a huge score of 107!  They also go into pole position for the highest score of the season prize.  The score was even more impressive given only 9 of their players played, and their midfield scored 77 points which is almost more than any other team in the league this week!<br><br>
Commiserations to @Cooper Reeves and @Mo Alrisheq who went out of LMS this week with scores of 38 and 44 respectively.  Only 13 left in LMS now with another 2 due to leave in GW8.<br><br>
@Luke Schreiber and @Kevin also feature on this week's best transfer, bringing in Ziyech for James Rodriguez.  @Mikael Nilsson features in the transfer news after he wildcarded out Grealish and Wilson<br><br>
Lots of jockeying for position in the league still, with less than 50 points separating the top 20.  @Jake Dyer still in #1 spot with @Ryan Swaim and @Robert Aikens just behind.<br><br>
2 games on Friday so the deadline is even earlier in GW8 - don't miss it.  Good luck all!<br><br>

Week 8 Update
Gameweek 8 update is attached and we are into another International Break (booooring!)<br><br>
Congrats to @Forrest Dyer for an incredible Wildcard that netted him 43 points over the team he transferred out and a huge 99 points for the gameweek winning him Manager of the Week!<br><br>
Commiserations to @nmulford and @Brian for going out of LMS this week with scores of 45 points (just 1 point from safety!).  Watkins scoring a brace on @Brianâ€™s bench, a cruel way to end the week.<br><br>
I've added in change in rank this week which shows @Forrest Dyer moved up 15 places from 18th to 3rd in the league!  On the other end, the biggest falls were @Brian and @Eduardo Tierney who dropped 7 places to 20th and 21st.<br><br>
2 weeks until the next GW now, where 2 more will go out of LMS - we are down to 11 managers now.  GW9 is the last week where 2 will be eliminated - congrats to those that have made it this far!<br><br>
Good luck in GW9!<br><br>

9 different winners in the first 9 weeks!<br><br>
Commiserations to @Luke Schreiber / @Kevin and @Daniel Alvarez for going out of this week's LMS with scores of 30 and 44 respectively<br><br>
Only 9 remaining in LMS now and we are moving to 1 per week starting in GW10.  Congrats @Robert Aikens  @Ryan Swaim @Jake Dyer @Michael Adams @Mike Reiffsteck @mskouyoudjian @Mikael Nilsson @Eduardo Tierney @Rob for making it this far!<br><br>
Biggest movers in the league this week were @Mikael Nilsson moving up 7 spots and @Luke Schreiber / @Kevin moving down 11 places.  All extremely bunched up still from 9th down.<br><br>
Best transfers of the week goes to @Mike Reiffsteck who brought in and captained Bruno as well as Calvert-Lewin for Salah and Wilson.  Worst transfers was @Luke Schreiber / @Kevin who sold Calvert-Lewin, Aurier and Salah for Bamford, Aubameyang (C) and Walker.<br><br>
A few slight changes at the top of the league, @Robert Aikens remains top, now with a 17 point lead, with @Forrest Dyer and @Mike Doherty in 2nd and 3rd.<br><br>

GW10 is over and we're down to 8 in LMS!<br><br>
A painful final game watching Watkins somehow not get a single point, but I still managed to escape with this week's MotW with a score of 62.<br><br>
Commiserations to @mskouyoudjian who went out of LMS this week with a score of 32 - congrats to the last 8 managers remaining.  1 manager will get knocked out each gameweek now until the New Year.<br><br>
@Eduardo Tierney was the biggest positive mover in the league, moving up 7 places to 10th.  @Cooper Reeves went in the other direction moving 6 places down to 19th.  Still all extremely close as less than 50 points covers 9th to 23rd.<br><br>
@Robert Aikens remains at the top of the league but @Forrest Dyer has narrowed the gap to just 6 points with @Mike Doherty a further 11 behind.<br><br>
I've added some simple stats which help highlight some of the key PL teams to target on page 5.<br><br>
Also, make sure to check out some of the upgrades @tFox has made to the live scoring on our website www.negatrophy.com/live - some incredible work showing how important each player's GW score is to your team in relation to the rest of the league along with some other cool stats and features. Thanks @tFox!<br><br>
It's a Friday kick off again in GW11, don't miss it - good luck all!<br><br>
