<p>I hope you all had a good Holiday.  A week for the Free Hitters with some big scores flying around for those that got rid of Liverpool for Arsenal or City players.</p>
<p>Congrats to @Robert Aikens on his first ever Manager of the Week in 4 seasons!  A very successful Free Hit played with a score of 65. @Ryan Swaim and @Tom Oeltgen both came in 2nd with 57 points, and were coincidentally matched up in the Group B European Cup fixture - both very unlucky to only get a draw in that game this week.</p>
<p>The second round of group stage fixtures have been completed in the European Cup.  @tFox and @Mike Reiffsteck both getting strong starts with 2 wins from 2 so far in Groups C and E respectively.</p>
<p>In the Manager of the Month contest for December, we are moving into the final GW with only 13 points covering the top 6 so all to play for there - see attached for details.</p>
<p>Free Hits aside, @Ryan Swaim had the best transfers bringing in Mount and Dier for Havertz and Coady for a net 4 point gain.  @Chio Lopez had the worst selling Greenwood and Saint-Maximin for Bernardo and Broja for a loss of 8 points.</p>
<p>At this point (10pm Central Time on Monday December 27th), there are 8 games scheduled to go ahead in GW20 with Arsenal v Wolves and Leeds v Aston Villa both being postponed already.  The deadline is at 7.30am Central Time tomorrow morning - I would advise waiting until 7am to make any transfers in case there are further postponements but don't leave it too late as the FPL site crashed 3mins before the deadline in GW19!  I hope that didn't impact anyone this GW.</p>
<p>Reminder that this is the last opportunity to use you first wildcard if you still have it.  There are 7 managers that still haven't used it - you will lose it after 7.30am tomorrow unless you use it.  Also another reminder that everyone will be getting a second Free Hit chip.  There are 8 managers that have used their Free Hit this season (4 this week) so they will get another one.  The remaining 17 managers should all have 2 Free Hits going forward.</p>
<p>Still a bit of a minefield out there, trying to avoid cancelations, injuries and illnesses.  Good luck to everyone in GW20! <br>-DLC </p>

<p>Only 4 games in GW18 but still lots of good scores and we at least have a decent break until Boxing Day (26th) now.</p>
<p>Congrats to @Mike Doherty for this week's Manager of the Week, his 3rd of the year.  @Scotty P and @DLC coming in 2nd and 3rd with scores of 71 and 68 respectively.</p>
<p>The European Cup games kicked off this week with the first of 10 rounds in the group stage.  Each manager will get 2 byes and play 8 games in the group stage.  Check out the attachment for results, fixtures, group league tables and Champions League / Europa League qualifying rankings.</p>
<p>@Chio Lopez had the best transfers with a gain of 11 points bringing in Rudiger and Alexander-Arnold for Chalobah and Dier.  @Eduardo Tierney had the worst transfers bringing in Foden and Tierney for Sissoko and Alonso for a loss of 11 points.</p>
<p>Shout out to @Mike Doherty as well who is killing it in the league, I don't think we've ever had anyone near the Top 1k overall before and he currently is sitting at 1,761th in the world out of 8.8M teams.  The whole league is performing incredibly well this season, with the top 6 all in the Top 100k and the top 12 in the league all in the Top 1M teams - incredible achievement.</p>
<p>Fingers crossed the COVID situation gets under control in the UK soon, at this point in time all the Boxing Day fixtures are going ahead but keep an eye out as cancelations can happen up to 2 hours before the game starts.</p>
<p>Happy Holidays to everyone and Merry Christmas to those that celebrate!</p>
<p>The deadline is currently at 5am CT on Boxing Day so don't miss it. <br>-DLC</p>

Week 17 Update 
<p>See DLC's Gameweek update PDF here: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-GnxAcBWgWtnnb5q-WDtvI5N3bCkUH9s/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">This Week</a> or <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ygA9hVj2rmCc63RWZfQCcgvahFTClZOu?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> Full Set</a></p>
<p>The season seems to be getting crazier as more and more fixtures are getting canceled - a good idea to keep an eye on any fixture updates as the deadline approaches and not make any transfers until close to the deadline if possible.  At this point, GW18 is still going ahead but with only 5 fixtures currently - that may change in the next 24 hours.</p>
<p>The good news is, we had a great LMS final which fortunately was not impacted very much by any of the cancelations.  Congrats go to @Andy Georgevich who beat @Michael Adams by 1 point, 62 to 61!  Alonso getting subbed before Chelsea lost their clean sheet and Jota missing out on bonus points won it in the end.  Our first big prize of $250 goes to @Andy Georgevich!  @Michael Adams goes into Group D of the Euro Cup alongside @Mikael Nilsson @Chad Hamer @Eduardo Tierney and @Brian with @Andy Georgevich going into Group E alongside @Mike Reiffsteck @Mik Maloney @Sam O'Connell and @Chio Lopez.</p>
<p>Reminder that the Cup starts immediately in GW18.  The fixtures are in the attachment for the Group Stage which runs from GW18 to GW27.  The group stage standings will determine the Knock Out Stages which will run from GW28 to GW34.  Good luck to everyone in the Cup!</p>
<p>Manager of the Week @DLC had a ton of jam this week with 96 points after getting Broja's 12 points off the bench once the Watford game was canceled after the deadline.</p>
<p>@Mike Doherty had the best transfers bringing in Watkins and Foden for Ronaldo and Brownhill for a gain of 20 points.  @tFox had the worst bringing in Jesus and Dennis for Jimenez and Toney for a loss of 4.</p>
<p>GW18 is in 24 hours, don't miss the deadline but I would not be surprised if the remaining 5 games got canceled so hold off on those transfers until as late as possible.  With games being canceled there is a huge element of luck for some managers if they don't own the players with canceled games.  Unfortunately, there is nothing I can do about that and we have to play it as it is, the scoring will continue as long as the FPL site continues.  I hope you all understand.</p>
<p>Reminder that only 68% of the league have used their first wildcard so far.  That means there are 8 managers with a wildcard left - you can only use it up until the start of GW20, at which point everyone will get a new wildcard and if you haven't used yours you will lose it.  Perhaps not the safest time to use a wildcard given all the unknowns about whose game is going ahead but a reminder that you only have limited time to do so.</p>
<p>Stay safe, good luck navigating the next few gameweeks and good luck in GW18!</p>

<p>Commiserations to @DLC :disappointed_relieved: for going out of LMS with a score of 69.  Congrats to @Andy Georgevich and @Michael Adams who go through to the final of LMS next GW.  @DLC goes into Group C alongside @tFox @Brian Teitelbaum @Robert Aikens and @Raymond Bleth in the European Cup which kicks off in GW18 - not long to go!  Some big $$$ available in the Cup so time to focus on that if you feel your attempt at the league title is over this year.</p>
<p>@Ryan Swaim had the best transfers this week bringing in Cancelo and Dennis for Duffy and Toney for a gain of 12 points.  @Eduardo Tierney had the worst bringing in Jota and Antonio for Mbeumo and Kane for a loss of 6.</p>

<p>Commiserations to @Forrest Dyer who went out of LMS in 4th this week with a score of 42 on almost the last touch of the game as Ramsdale got his 3rd save of the game (and therefore 1 extra FPL point) in the 96th minute to take @Michael Adams to safety, 1 point clear.   @Forrest Dyer goes into Group B in the European Cup draw alongside @Chris Parkin, @Mo Alrisheq, @Tom Oeltgen and @Ryan Swaim.  3 remain in LMS.</p>
<p>@Travis Dyer had the best transfer of the week yet again bringing in Maupay for Antonio for a gain of 4 points after Maupay scored a very late equalizer against Southampton.  The worst transfers were from @Scotty P who took out Antonio and Raphinha for Dennis and Jota for a loss of 9 points.</p>
<p>I've added the European Cup fixtures for Group A and B in the attached update.  Reminder that the Cup kicks off in GW18 so prepare your teams!</p>
<p>Good luck to @Andy Georgevich, @Michael Adams and especially @DLC in LMS as we move into the penultimate week.</p>
<p>The Hall of Fame All Time Rankings have been updated on the website.  We've had 39 different managers across the 4 years and 14 managers have played every year.  The rankings are based on your performance in LMS, The League, The Cup(s), LCS and Manager of the Week and results are discounted the older they are so more recent performances count for more.  You can see the rankings here:  http://www.negatrophy.com/hof</p>
<p>The deadline for GW16 is on Friday this week at 7.30pm CET / 6.30pm UK / 1.30pm ET / 12.30pm CT / 11.30am MT (I think I covered all the time zones) - don't miss it! <br>-DLC</p>

<p>Commiserations to @Raymond Bleth who goes out of LMS with 45 points.  @Raymond Bleth joins @Robert Aikens @Brian Teitelbaum and @tFox in Group C of the European Cup draw.  We are down to 7 managers in LMS now.</p>
<p>@Mikael Nilsson had the best transfers of the week, bringing in James and Gallagher for Tsimikas and Fernandes for a net gain of 12 points.  @Mike Doherty had the worst transfers bringing in Toney, Son and Mitchell for Jimenez, Mount and Dias for a loss of 3 points.</p>
<p>The league race is still very tight with the top 11 all within 100 points of the league leader, @Mike Doherty.  For context, last year's champion, @Eduardo Tierney won from close to 100 points back at this stage of the season, so anything can happen.</p>
<p>GW12 kicks off on Saturday 20th November, so we all get a week to dwell on our seasons so far.  Good luck everyone in GW12!<br>-DLC</p>

<p>What a crazy GW9.  Huge defeats for Norwich and Man Utd and a sad week for anyone that didn't captain Salah!</p>
<p>Congrats to @Mike Doherty who won Manager of the Week with a season high score of 115!  Congrats also to @Mo Alrisheq who came in 2nd with 104 and @Travis Dyer who came 3rd with 101 points.</p>
<p>Commiserations to @Sam O'Connell and @Chio Lopez who went out of LMS with scores of 68 and 72 respectively.  Only 9 remaining in LMS now as we move to 1 eliminated each week starting in GW10.</p>
<p>Manager of the Month for October is very tight, @Mike Doherty leads the way on 208 points but the top 5 are all within 10 points so anyone can win it going into the last GW of the month.</p>
<p>The best transfer of the week was @Jake Dyer who brought in Salah for a whopping 24 points and the worst goes to @Ryan Swaim who brought in Havertz for Jota and Laporte for Alonso.</p>
<p>The league race is pretty tight with the top 4 only 16 points apart and the top 12 in the league are all in the top 1 million overall.  Great standard this year!</p>
<p>GW10 kicks off on Saturday, don't miss the deadline!  Good luck everyone. <br>-DLC</p>

<p>GW8 is complete after another long international break and a close one in LMS this week!</p>
<p>Congrats to @Andy Georgevich who won this week's Manager of the Week with a score of 69!  @Syed Abidi came in 2nd for the 2nd week in a row and @Forrest Dyer came in 3rd.</p>
<p>Commiserations to @Robert Aikens and @Eduardo Tierney who went out of LMS with scores of 48 and 49 respectively.  @Scotty P escaped on the 3rd tiebreaker (worst league position) and survives another week.  For those following along, it was a lot of bad luck in the final game (thanks to Arsenal players!) that saw @Robert Aikens and @Eduardo Tierney crash out.  2 more managers will go out in GW9.</p>
<p>@Syed Abidi takes a 3 point lead from @Andy Georgevich in the Manager of the Month contest for October.  2 more GWs to go in October.</p>
<p>The best transfer this week was @tFox who brought in Greenwood for Barnes and @Scotty P had the worst bringing in Raphinha for Greenwood, although probably a good long term move.</p>
<p>Short turnaround this week, with the deadline being on Friday - don't miss it!</p>
<p>Good luck in GW9 everyone!</p>

<p>Commiserations to @Travis Dyer and @Tom Oeltgen who go out of LMS with scores of 25 and 33 respectively.  We've got some good rivalry draws in the European Cups already as @Travis Dyer goes into Group A along with @Jake Dyer.  @tFox is also in the same group as @Brian Teitelbaum in Group C.  13 remain in LMS as we go into GW8.  For those left, if you can survive GW8 and 9, we will be moving to only 1 eliminated each week starting in GW10.</p>
<p>With GW7 being the first GW of the month, @Ryan Swaim goes into a nice lead in the October Manager of the Month race.</p>
<p>The best transfer move of the week goes to @Mike Doherty who brought in Azpilicueta for Alexander-Arnold for a gain of 10 points.  @Tom Oeltgen had the worst moves totaling -10 after removing Duffy and Gray for Alonso and Douglas Luiz.</p>
<p>Enjoy the 2 weeks away from FPL and good luck to everyone in GW8!</p>

<p>GW6 had the lowest average score for the league this season at 47 points, so well done if you scored more than that.</p>
<p>Congrats to @Tom Oeltgen who played his wildcard this week and score an impressive 73 points, 12 more than @Syed Abidi and @Travis Dyer who came joint second this week with 61.</p>
<p>Commiserations to @Mo Alrisheq and @Mike Doherty who scored 36 and 37 points respectively and go out of LMS in 17th and 16th place.  @Brian sneaked through on the 3rd tiebreaker (worst league position) against @Mike Doherty.  15 managers remain as we go into GW7 this weekend.</p>
<p>Manager of the Month for September was also won by @Tom Oeltgen with 204 points in total.  There is a 3 way tie for 2nd place between @Forrest Dyer, @Michael Adams and @DLC all with 189 points.  Congrats again @Tom Oeltgen!</p>
<p>I've added a new stat to track best and worst transfers of the GW, found on the GW Summary tab. I've added a new stat found on the gameweek summary tab to show the best and the worst transfers of the round. I brought in Sarr for Torres for a gain of 9 points.  @Syed Abidi had the worst transfer of the week bringing in Torres for Jota for a loss of 7 points.</p>
<p>GW7 kicks off on Saturday - the last gameweek before another International Break.  Good luck everyone!</p>

<p>GW5 is over after a bit of a rollercoaster weekend with key players getting benched.  I just noticed that the Top 12 in the league are all in the top 1M overall, which is very impressive - the competition in the league is dramatically improving each year!</p>
<p>Congrats to @Michael Adams and @Forrest Dyer for winning Manager of the Week in GW5 with great scores of 77 each.  They are both also leading the Manager of the Month race with just 1 week to go, on 146 points each, just 5 ahead of @Mike Doherty.</p>
<p>Commiserations to Chad Hamer and @Brian Teitelbaum who finished with scores of 38 and 42 respectively and went out of LMS this week.  We are now down to 17 teams left with another two to go again in GW6.</p>
<p>I've added a few extra stats in this week - Gameweek summary is intended to provide a visual on how everyone performed this week - I've included a few basics and a comparison to the Top 5 in the league.  It's pretty bare right now, I will keep adding to it over the weeks.  Also included FPL Points Conceded on the Team Stats slide which should help you in your benching/transfer decisions to see how the teams your players are facing next have been performing.  I'll try to add in some specific player stats in the next few weeks also.</p>
<p>20% of the league wildcarded in GW5 with most scoring in the 60s and 70s, above the league average of 59.  Approximately a third of the league have used their wildcard already this season - not surprising given the big name late additions to the league.</p>
<p>I hope you are all enjoying the quality of football this season as much as me - it's been a joy to watch especially with the crowds back.</p>
<p>GW6 kicks off early on Saturday morning, don't miss the deadline.  There are Carabao Cup fixtures mid week also, so watch out for any injuries.  Good luck in GW6!</p>

<p>after a long International Break, GW4 did not disappoint.  Ronaldo immediately making an impact, Lukaku matching him and an Antonio red card were the high/lowlights of the week and we're straight into GW5 again this Friday.</p>
<p>Congrats to @Andy Georgevich for winning this week's Manager of the Week with a great score of 82 points.</p>
<p>Commiserations to @Mike Reiffsteck and @Mik Maloney who went out of LMS this week after both captaining Antonio.  19 remain in LMS as we go into GW5.</p>

<p>GW3 is over and we're already on to the first International Break of the season - 2 weeks until the next deadline.</p>
<p>Another Manager of the Week for me and also the first Manager of the Month this season - a very fortunate Son goal today made that happen.  @Mike Doherty and @Forrest Dyer come in 2nd and 3rd in the August Manager of the Month.</p>
<p>Commiserations to @tFox and the LMS reigning champion @Mikael Nilsson who went out in LMS this week with scores of 36 and 39 respectively.</p>
<p>2 weeks off until the next deadline and lots to think about with Ronaldo about to be added to the game and lots of confusion about who will and won't be quarantined after they play for their countries - good luck selecting those teams for GW4!</p>

LMS starts in GW2 which kicks off early (6am ET) on Saturday<br><br>

We're finally at the end of one crazy gameweek.<br><br>

Another GW in the books with an average of over 4 goals per game and crazy upsets this week - the Premier League is certainly entertaining this year.<br><br>
Congrats to Mike Reiffsteck for winning this week's Manager of the Week with a score of 82!<br><br>
Commiserations to DLC and Forrest Dyer for crashing out of LMS with miserable scores of 28 ad 37.  We both go into Group E for the European Cups as the snake draft starts filling up the second player in each group.  2 more will go out of LMS again in GW5.<br><br>
Pace setter Mik Maloney is still setting the pace at the top of the league, 7 points clear of #1 ranked Hall of Famer Ryan Swaim with Chris Parkin rounding off the top 3.<br><br>
It's the International Break now (thank god) so no games next week - we will be back on Oct 17 for GW5.<br><br>
Reminder to Mik Maloney (not that he needs to change anything) and mskouyoudjian that you have 1 free transfer each week to use to change your team up. Just noticed that you both haven't used a transfer yet this season.<br><br>
Enjoy the week off everyone!  See you all in 2 weeks time - good luck for GW5!<br><br>

Congrats to @Luke Schreiber and @Kevin for winning this week's Manager of the Week with a huge score of 107!  They also go into pole position for the highest score of the season prize.

Commiserations to @Cooper Reeves and @Mo Alrisheq who went out of LMS this week with scores of 38 and 44 respectively.  Only 13 left in LMS now with another 2 due to leave in GW8.<br><br>
@Luke Schreiber and @Kevin also feature on this week's best transfer, bringing in Ziyech for James Rodriguez.  @Mikael Nilsson features in the transfer news after he wildcarded out Grealish and Wilson<br><br>
Lots of jockeying for position in the league still, with less than 50 points separating the top 20.  @Jake Dyer still in #1 spot with @Ryan Swaim and @Robert Aikens just behind.<br><br>
2 games on Friday so the deadline is even earlier in GW8 - don't miss it.  Good luck all!<br><br>

I've added some simple stats which help highlight some of the key PL teams to target on page 5.<br><br>

It's now crunch time in FPL, with games coming thick and fast over the holiday period - stay on top of your team otherwise you will miss a deadline or two over this period!  GW13 kicks off on Tuesday (in 2 days!) so don't miss it!<br><br>

Lastly, heads up if you did not already know - 5 GW18 fixtures have been rescheduled into GW19, so GW18 is now a blank GW with only 10 teams playing and GW19 is a double GW with 10 teams playing twice.  A great opportunity to score some big points with a bit of planning!<br><br>

COVID strikes again with two games getting canceled this week and the potential for more to be canceled in GW17.  Fulham and Man City the teams hit hardest but Sheff Utd reported to also have a high number of positive tests.  Some very bad luck for some managers - couldn't have come at a worse time for @Eduardo Tierney who crashes out of LMS with 4 of his starting XI getting impacted by the cancelations. As a result, @Eduardo Tierney goes into Group C of the Euro Cup competitions and will faceoff against @tFox, @Andy Georgevich, @Nate and @Jake Dyer for Champions League qualification.<br><br>
Congrats to @Robert Aikens and @Mikael Nilsson who scored well in a difficult week with 61 and 71 respectively to qualify for the LMS Grand Finale! @Mikael Nilsson clinching the second Festive Manager of the Week title along with $20.  Good luck to you both in the GW17 final.<br><br>
In the league, @Robert Aikens and @Mike Doherty are quietly building up a substantial lead, with @Robert Aikens 22 points ahead of @Mike Doherty and a further 46 ahead of @Forrest Dyer in 3rd place, who got hit really hard this week by the cancelations.<br><br>
@Mikael Nilsson also the biggest mover in the league this week, climbing 4 places from 12th up to 8th.  @Michael Adams headed in the opposite direction dropping from 6th to 9th.<br><br>
GW17 kicks off on Friday morning - so don't miss the deadline.  The last fixture of the congested period, so we will have a 10 day or so break before GW18 and the European Cup kicks off.  A nice rest after we've rounded off LMS and determined our first major prize winner for the season - let's hope COVID doesn't spoil the final and that all the (real life) players are fit and healthy.<br><br>
Good luck all<br><br>

Blank gameweek 18 comes to a close after some low scoring games.  Despite some disappointing performances from the premium players, the Free Hitters and Wildcarders seem to have made some ground on the rest of the league.<br><br>

Double gameweek 19 kicks off on Saturday morning - there are some fixture changes again so pay attention.  Saints and Leeds no longer have a double, Everton have a blank and Villa play Newcastle instead, both of who have a double.  I'm sure we will see the chips flying again this week.

The longest and highest scoring GW of the season so far with 6 GW scores over 100!  I got Manager of the Week with a score of 128 after getting lucky with the bench boost.  But it was a week to forget for the premium players with none of the main captain choices getting double digits so it was all about which defenders (e.g. Stones) and cheaper attackers you had this week.<br><br>
After 9 of the last 11 GWs in the lead, @Robert Aikens drops to 2nd place but is only 5 points behind new league leader @Mike Doherty with @Eduardo Tierney, who has moved up into 3rd place, a further 19 points behind.<br><br>
The second round of the group stages of the cup is also complete.  Some very close games with @Cooper Reeves beating @Rob by 3, @tFox beating @Andy Georgevich by 2 and @mskouyoudjian sneaking past @Brian by 2.  Still another 8 weeks of the group stage left so there's plenty of time to recover if you're yet to win a game.  For full details of the results and current standings, check the PDF attached.<br><br>
The gameweeks are still coming at us at lightning speed with GW20 kicking off on Tuesday, once the FA Cup 4th round has been wrapped up this weekend.  No more blanks or doubles in the next few weeks (at the moment) but looks like GW26 might be shaping up to be the next big double GW - FA Cup results will determine how big.<br><br>
Don't miss the deadline on Tuesday - good luck all in GW20!<br><br>

We're through GW20 and straight on to GW21 tomorrow morning.  Back to normal with a mini league GW average of 50 points but @Andy Georgevich's captain pick Cancelo saw him get a mini league high 88 points to win this week's Manager of the Week - Congrats!<br><br>
We have a 3 horse race at the top of the league right now with @Mike Doherty leading the way, 11 points ahead of @Robert Aikens and 19 points ahead of @Eduardo Tierney.<br><br>
Round 3 of the Cup Group Stage is also in the books - a couple of close games this week with @tFox edging passed @Nate by 2 points and @Luke Schreiber and @Kevin beating @DLC by 3 :white_frowning_face:.<br><br>
@Andy Georgevich the biggest mover in the league, going up 5 places from 21st to 16th with @Chris Parkin going in the other direction down to 21st from 18th.<br><br>
Short turnaround (again) to the next GW deadline which is in about 24 hours - good luck all in GW21.<br><br>

Lots of players missing has led to a polarizing week in GW21 but if you had a bad week, don't worry, GW22 starts in about 36 hours.<br><br>
Congrats to @Eduardo Tierney for winning Manager of the Week with a score of 84 after vice captain Salah finally delivered after 6 blanks.  @Eduardo Tierney also jumps to the top of the league now with that score, 11 points ahead of @Mike Doherty and 15 ahead of @Robert Aikens.<br><br>
The biggest movers in the league this week were @Daniel Alvarez and @Chris Parkin moving up 3 places to 11th and 18th respectively.  @Forrest Dyer, @tFox and @Luke Schreiber/@Kevin all moved down 3 places to 8th, 14th and 22nd respectively.<br><br>
Not too many close matches in the group stage of the cup this week - @Michael Adams beating @Cooper Reeves by 3 points was the closest.  GW22 marks the half way point of the group stages, so we'll take stock of the league positions at the end of that GW, once everyone has played 4 matches.<br><br>
Good luck in GW22 everyone!<br><br>

GW22 goes into the record books for the worst ever score by a player after Bednarek's -7 points.  Tough luck to anyone that owned him - the red card has since been rescinded but the negative points remain!<br><br>
Congrats to @Jake Dyer for winning this week's Manager of the Week with a great score of 89 after captain Bruno's late haul at the 9-0 drubbing of Southampton.<br><br>
@Eduardo Tierney remains top of the league but the gap has narrowed to just 8 points with @Robert Aikens in 2nd and @Mike Doherty only 1 point further back in 3rd.<br><br>
@Forrest Dyer is this week's biggest mover after a score of 86, moving up 4 places from 8th to 4th.  @Daniel Alvarez going in the other direction from 11th to 14th.<br><br>
We're at the half way point in the group stages with each team having played 4 times.  @Michael Adams, @tFox, @Mo Alrisheq and @Syed Abidi all with perfect records still.  Another 4 matches and 5 GWs to go to finalize the Champions League/Europa League qualifying.<br><br>
GW23 kicks off on Saturday.  Take note that GW24 and GW25 are both small double gameweeks now - keep an eye on the fixtures as another double GW is likely to be announced soon once the FA Cup 5th round is played.<br><br>

The PL title race might be over after this weekend but our mini league race is still alive and kicking.  Congrats to @Raymond Bleth for winning this week's Manager of the Week after a score of 90, even after captain Antonio blanked!  @Raymond Bleth is also the biggest mover up the league from 9th to 5th, with @Forrest Dyer moving in the opposite direction from 4th to 8th.<br><br>
@Eduardo Tierney remains at the top of the league, now 20 points clear of @Robert Aikens in 2nd and a further 2 points back to @Mike Doherty in 3rd.  @Mike Reiffsteck and @Raymond Bleth closed the gap slightly to the top 3 this week.<br><br>
Week 6 of the group stages of the cup saw @Cooper Reeves sneak past @Scotty P 74-72 and @Syed Abidi beat @Brian 60-57 in the two closest matches of the week.  @Michael Adams, @tFox and @Syed Abidi all have their perfect records in tact still with 5 wins from 5.  Group E looks like it will go down to the wire with no one able to break away from the group.<br><br>
We finally have a few days of breathing room while the FA Cup games are played this week - good luck to Swansea against Man City!  The next GW deadline is on Saturday, when GW24 kicks off with Burnley, Man City, Fulham and Everton playing twice.  As I mentioned in the last update, keep an eye out on the fixtures - GW26 will almost certainly be a big double gameweek and there's a possibility that GW27 and 28 could also be small doubles.<br><br>
Good luck in GW24.<br><br>

Group E could not be more wide open with 4 of the 5 teams all on 3 wins.<br><br>
Congrats to @Raymond Bleth who incredibly is through to round 9 in the Official FPL Cup on the website - good luck Ray!<br><br>

Congrats to @Michael Adams for winning GW25's Manager of the Week with a score of 97 after the Leeds trio of Bamford, Raphinha and Dallas delivered in the last game of the GW.<br><br>
In the race for this year's league title and coveted trophy, @Mike Doherty takes the lead again, 5 points ahead of @Eduardo Tierney and 39 points ahead of @Robert Aikens.  The top 3 still have a decent gap back to the chasing pack led by @Mike Reiffsteck in 4th place.<br><br>
Not much movement in league places this week, @Mo Alrisheq is the biggest mover going from 18th to 16th, with @Daniel Alvarez headed in the opposite direction dropping from 16th to 18th.<br><br>
In the cup, @Mike Reiffsteck beat @Raymond Bleth in a close match 86 v 83 to keep group B qualification alive.  @Eduardo Tierney sneaked past @tFox 69 v 60 to also keep group C wide open.  @Brian beat @Chris Parkin 73 v 67 in the last of the close games to keep his chances of Champions League qualification alive in group D also.<br><br>
@Mo Alrisheq is the only person to have secured a bye to the Champions League quarter finals so far with an insurmountable lead in group B.  Group A also sees @Mike Doherty and @Michael Adams both securing Champions League qualification but the bye is yet to be determined between the two of them.  The last qualifier is @Syed Abidi in group D, who has secured CL qualification but not a bye yet.  Two more rounds and all to play for.<br><br>
Congrats to @Raymond Bleth who yet again makes it through in the Official FPL cup and is now in round 10 - good luck Ray!<br><br>
A big double gameweek coming up in GW26 - potential for some huge season defining scores so good luck everyone!  Deadline is on Saturday morning don't miss it!<br><br>

Congrats to @Syed Abidi for his first Manager of the Week with a great score of 103!  It could've been a lot more as triple captain Kane uncharacteristically missed several big chances.<br><br>
@Mike Doherty extended his lead at the top of the league to 13 points ahead of @Eduardo Tierney, with @Robert Aikens a further 31 points behind.<br><br>
@Syed Abidi also jumped up 3 places in the league and was this week's biggest mover up to 12th place from 15th.  @Michael Adams moving in the opposite direction dropping from 7th to 9th place.<br><br>
The penultimate round of group stage matches saw a lot of close games, @Scotty P beating @Rob 79 to 74, @Mike Doherty beating @Michael Adams 79 to 75 and @Eduardo Tierney beating @Andy Georgevich 67 to 61, the closest of the bunch.  Group C is still completely wide open with @tFox, @Eduardo Tierney, @Andy Georgevich and @Jake Dyer all vying for Champions League qualification with only 3 points separating all 4 of them.  @Mike Doherty, @Michael Adams, @Mo Alrisheq, @Syed Abidi, @Robert Aikens and @DLC have all secured qualification, with just the bye spots and seeding to be worked out in the final week of the group stage.<br><br>
We are still following @Raymond Bleth's progress in the Official FPL cup who yet again won this week and is through to round 11 - good luck Ray!<br><br>
Good luck to everyone in the last round of the group stages of the cup - the gameweek kicks off on Saturday morning.<br><br>

The European Cup group stage concluded this gameweek with some drama in both Group C and E.<br><br>
@Andy Georgevich with Foden captain did just enough to beat @Jake Dyer by 60 points to 58 and sneak into top spot in the group after @Nate beat @Eduardo Tierney 58 to 56 when Raheem Sterling was a no show for Ed.  That meant that @tFox held on to the second Champions League qualifying spot in the group with @Eduardo Tierney and @Jake Dyer narrowly missing out on the wildcard spot to @Brian who beat @Robert Aikens by 1 point!<br><br>
@Mo Alrisheq sealed the #1 seed in Champions League qualifying and Manager of the Week with 101 points and a win over @Mike Reiffsteck who dropped into the Europa League as a result but secured a bye into the Quarter Final as #2 Europa seed (#13 seed overall).  @Daniel Alvarez overturned a 48 point deficit against @Forrest Dyer - Daniel had to win by more than 24 points to qualify for Champions League and won 82 to 53 (29 point diff<br><br>erence).  That meant that @Forrest Dyer fell into the Europa League as #1 seed (#12 overall) securing the only other bye to the quarter finals in that competition.
Group winners @Michael Adams @Mo Alrisheq @Andy Georgevich @Syed Abidi and @DLC all secured a bye to the Champions League Quarter finals.  @Mike Doherty @Raymond Bleth @tFox @Robert Aikens @Brian @Daniel Alvarez the other 6 qualifiers will play the Last 16 in GW28.  Check out the attachment for all the details and both brackets!<br><br>
A good week in the league for @Robert Aikens who closed the gap to @Mike Doherty and @Eduardo Tierney at the top of the league but no movement between the top 3.  @Mo Alrisheq and @Daniel Alvarez were this week's biggest movers in the league going from 16th and 18th to 13th and 15th respectively.  @tFox went in the opposite direction from 14th to 17th.<br><br>
@Raymond Bleth's Official FPL cup run is finally over in round 11 - great run though Ray!<br><br>
Good luck to everyone in the knock out stages of the cup - reminder that each round is 2 legs apart from the final which is just 1.  GW28 will be the first leg of the Last 16 and kicks off on Friday so don't miss it!<br><br>

**UPDATE** 
Thanks to @Mikael Nilsson for pointing out my mistake in the fixtures/bracket.<br><br>
Technical issue that has been updated in the attached.  @tFox is playing @Syed Abidi and @Mo Alrisheq is playing @Robert Aikens, not the other way around as per the previous deck.<br><br>
Thanks @Mikael Nilsson!  That could have been a disaster.<br><br>

At the top of the table, reigning champ @Eduardo Tierney sneaks back into the lead ahead of @Mike Doherty by 1 point with @Robert Aikens 14 points further back.  The top 3 are pulling away again slowly with only 8 weeks remaining!<br><br>

The semi finals of the cup are over - @tFox and @Andy Georgevich with some tactical maneuvers and good chip usage to beat @Mike Doherty and @Robert Aikens in the Champions League.  @Chris Parkin did his best to try to catch @Ryan Swaim in the Europa League but the leg 1 lead was too great.  @Mikael Nilsson overturned a 10 point deficit to defeat @Eduardo Tierney by 3 points.<br><br>

A crazy weekend of football after fans storm Old Trafford and get the biggest game of the weekend (FPL and real life) postponed.  Very unfortunate timing for our league with it coinciding with the Cup Finals - I apologize to those negatively impacted by it, but we have to accept the gameweek events as we have done all year with covid.<br><br>
Congrats to @tFox who is crowned this year's Champion's League winner after a 4 point victory over @Andy Georgevich!  Vladimir Coufal winning it for Tom with an assist in the final game of the gameweek.<br><br>
Congrats to @Ryan Swaim for winning the Europa League by 35 points over @Mikael Nilsson after a strong bench boost.  @Ryan Swaim also secured Manager of the Week with a score of 63!<br><br>
With the European Cups over, we're straight into the Last Chance Saloon competition now, with only 4 weeks in the season left to go!  Check out the bracket in the attached - @Mike Doherty @Eduardo Tierney @Robert Aikens and @Raymond Bleth the only players not qualified for LCS as all are within 75 points of the league leader.  First round matches are here - everyone else that has qualified has a bye into the Quarter Finals.<br><br>
In the league, @Mike Doherty is still out in front, 33 points ahead of @Robert Aikens and 46 points ahead of @Eduardo Tierney in 3rd.  @Raymond Bleth is a further 25 points behind @Eduardo Tierney.<br><br>
Keep an eye out for the fixtures, there is a double gameweek in GW35 and a blank in GW36 but the Man Utd v Liverpool game may impact the schedule in the next few days again so look out for further changes before the Friday deadline.<br><br>
Good luck everyone in LCS and congrats again to the winners and finalists in the European Cups!<br><br>

In the league, @Eduardo Tierney pulls ahead again and now leads @Mike Doherty by 20 points going in to the final week.  @Robert Aikens a further 19 points behind in 3rd.

  Season Recap</a> <br><br>
A very long and eventful season is finally over with a crazy last gameweek - so much fun when all the games are at the
same time!<br><br>
What a finish to the league race! @Eduardo Tierney seemingly had it wrapped up going into the final week only for @Mike
Doherty to go 2 points ahead with Mane captain, until the 90th minute when West Brom wiped out the Leeds clean sheet. 3
points the difference in the end and both managers finishing in the Top 100k overall - incredible result!<br><br>
Congrats to @Eduardo Tierney - double gameweek 35 was the turning point with an incredible 171 points - Ed was only 1st
for 5 weeks of the season before GW35 and never let it go after that. Ed also takes home the prize for the highest GW
score of the season and is clear at the top of the Hall of Fame All Time Rankings (can be seen on the website)
now!<br><br>
Congrats to @Mike Doherty also for coming in 2nd place in the league! Mike was top for 11 gameweeks in total and almost
snatched it back at the very end.<br><br>
Congrats to @Robert Aikens for 3rd place in the league. RC dominated the first half of the season, leading the league
for 9 gameweeks in total and secures his highest ever league position this year as well as rising up to 2nd in the All
Time Rankings!<br><br>
In the Last Chance Saloon competition, @Mike Reiffsteck beat @Michael Adams even against the bench boost by 80 points to
71 in the Tier 1 final - congrats Mike! @Daniel Alvarez also beat @Scotty P by 1 point with a score of 42 to 41 to win
the Tier 2 final in his first season in the league, congrats Daniel!<br><br>
This year's Rookie of the Year, the award for the best performing newcomer, goes to @Jake Dyer who finished 9th in the
league and won 2 manager of the weeks. Jake led the league for 2 gameweeks early in the season also. Lots of great
performances from the newcomers this year so there was a lot of competition. Congrats @Jake Dyer!<br><br>
Reminder also of the winners of the competitions that finished earlier in the season:
<ul>
  <li>Champion's League Winner: @tFox</li>
  <li>Europa League Winner: @Ryan Swaim</li>
  <li>Last Man Standing: @Mikael Nilsson</li>
</ul>
I've sent/tried to send something for these 3 comps and will also be sending the League Trophy to @Eduardo Tierney -
would love to see a picture of you guys with it if you'd like to share.<br><br>
Attached are also some stats for the season - let me know if you'd like a download of your data as well.<br><br>
Finally, I hope you've all enjoyed the competitions this season - it's been another challenging season with COVID and
long drawn out gameweeks but hopefully this gave you some outlet and entertainment for the year. Hopefully fans will be
back next season and we'll be somewhat back to normal. I really enjoy running the league and the side games and if you
have any feedback for improvements I am always happy to hear them so please reach out.<br><br>
Hope to see you all back in August for the next season!<br>
