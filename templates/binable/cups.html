        <h4>Rules</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>European Cups (Champions League and Europa League) will run from GW23 to GW34</li>
          <li>The team scoring the most FPL points (transfer costs DO NOT get deducted from your weekly score as with LMS) each match will be awarded the win</li>
          <li>In the group stages, managers will be awarded 3 points for a win and 1 point for a draw just like the PL</li>
          <li>Group winners will get a bye into second round of the Champions League (CL) knockout stages </li>
          <li>Second place in the group plus one Wildcard team will qualify for the first round of the CL knockout stages </li>
          <li>All other teams qualify for the Europa League (EL) </li>
          <li>In the event of a tie on points in the league positions, the following will be used as tiebreakers:
            <ul>
              <li> FPL points difference in the group games </li>
              <li> Lowest league position as at that point in time </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Wildcard entry to the CL and EL seedings are determined by best record (Win %, FPL points difference, lowest league position as at that point in time)</li>
          <li>Knock-out stages will be played over 2 legs, the manager with the highest aggregate FPL points score over the two weeks will advance</li>
          <li>In the event of a tie in the knockout stages (highly unlikely), the same tiebreakers as LMS will be used â€“ captain score (combined across both weeks), then VC score (combined), then lowest league position at that point in time </li>
          <li>The final will be just one leg played in GW34, with the team with the highest FPL points in that week declared the winner.  In the event of a tie, highest captain score, then VC score, then lowest league position will be used as a tiebreaker </li>
          <li>Use of any chip in any week is allowed and is recommended as a strategy to do well in the cup if that is your goal </li>
          <li>The winner of the CL will receive $300 </li>
          <li>The winner of the EL will receive $150</li>
        </ul>
